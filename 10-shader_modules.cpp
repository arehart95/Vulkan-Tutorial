/* Shader code in Vulkan has to be specified in bytecode format as opposed to human-readable
  	syntax like GLSL and HLSL. This format is called SPIR-V and is designed to be used with both
	Vulkan and OpenCL. 
	
	The advantage of using a bytecode format is that the compilers written by GPU vendors to turn
	shader code into native code are significantly less complex. Khronos has released their own
	vendor-independent compiler that compiles GLSL into SPIR-V. For this tutorial we will use
	glslc.exe by Google instead. It uses the same parameter format as well-known compilers like
	GCC and Clang and includes extra functionality like includes. 
	
	GLSL is a shading language with a C-like syntax. Programs have a main function that is invoked
	for every object. Instead of using parameters for input and a return value as output, GLSL uses
	global variables. The language includes many features such as matrix and vector primitives. 
	Functions for operations like cross-products, matrix-vector products, and reflections around a
	vector are included. 
	
	The vector type is called vec with a number indicating the amount of elements. A 3D position
	would be stored in vec3. It is possible to access single components with .x, but it is also
	possible to create a new vector from multiple components at the same time. For example, the 
	expression vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0).xy would result in vec2. The constructors of vectors can also
	take combinations of vecotr objects and scalar values. vec3 can be constructed with
	vec3(vec2(1.0, 2.0), 3.0).
	
	Vertex Shader
	
	The vertex shader processes each incoming vertex. It takes attriubtes, like world position,
	color, normal and texture coordinates, etc. as input. The output is the final position in the
	clip coordinates and the attributes that need to be passed on to the fragment shader, like
	color and texture coordinates. 
	
	A clip coordinate is s four dimensional vector from the vertex shader that is subsequently
	turned into a normalized device coordinate by diving the whole vector by its last component. 
	These normalized device coordinates are homogenous coordinates that map the framebuffer to a
	[-1, 1], by [-1, 1] coordinate system.
	
	We can directly output normalized device coordinates by outputting them as clip coordinates
	from the vertex shader with the last component set to 1. That way the division to transform
	clip coordinates will not change anything. 
	
	For this example we will include the coordinates directly in the vertex shader.

	The main function is called for every fragment. Colors in GLSL are 4-component vectors with

	there is no built-in variable to output a color for the current fragment. You have to specify
	your own output variable for each framebuffer where the layout(location = 0) modifier
